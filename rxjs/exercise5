Exercise 5

--

CREATE TABLE company (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  address VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

1 - Build a corresponding class

2 - Based on previous experience, provide a service (client) to consume the following CRUD api :

GET /companies
GET /companies/:id
POST /companies
PUT /companies/:id
DELETE /companies/:id
