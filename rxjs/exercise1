RxJS

Exercise 1

--

1 - Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI by running the following command in your terminal.

ng new angular_rxjs_ex1

2 - In the app component (src/app/app.component.ts), import the Observable class from RxJS by adding the following line at the top of the file.

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

3 - In the AppComponent class, create an observable that emits a sequence of numbers using the Observable.create() method.

const numbers = new Observable<number>((observer) => {
  let i = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    i++;
    observer.next(i);
  }, 1000);
});

4 - Subscribe to the observable and log the emitted values to the console (in the app component class).

numbers.subscribe((num) => console.log(num));

5 - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200. You should see the numbers being logged to the console every second.
